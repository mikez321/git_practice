Again, since I'm on a new branch this will be uploaded to the branch, but the master branch will remain untouched.  The master
branch won't even have this file!  Wild!

I just deleted the previous line and overwrote it.  But no biggie, I can always go back to that version because Git is a VCS
and my previous commit is saved!  Forever.... Forever..... Forever.... Forever......

Finally, once all is good to go you can commit files.
